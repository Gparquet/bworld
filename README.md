## About

I wanted to make a very simple multi-tenant website that would allow any beginner, artisan, farmer to sell their products and / or services very simply locally while keeping their visual identity. In the end, due to lack of time, this led to the realization of my personal website:
https://www.guillaume-chervet.fr
https://www.bworld.fr

As I spend more time to keep it afloat than to develop new features and that for lack of time the code deteriorates as and when, I open-source in the hope that maybe that will lead to something positive :)

Fonctionnalities :

- simple to use
- multi-tenant
- statistics
- user messaging
- share data: text, multimedia data (video, images, etc.)
- emailing
